Iâ€™m an undergraduate at [**Williams College**](https://www.williams.edu/) majoring in English and Computer Science. I was a visiting student at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year. I work on research at the intersection of **programming languages**, **human-computer interaction**, and **artificial intelligence**. 

I want computers to support human cognition and for the design of software to be attuned to it. To this end, I'm interested in novel information representations, both to improve documents with interactive reading and to improve the design of programming languages and software tools for verification and testing. This often involves evaluating the impact of AI augmentation in such interactive systems. I'm applying to PhD programs focusing on HCI, PL, and AI to pursue this.

This summer, I designed and conducted a study of expert users of proof-oriented languages at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) in Redmond, WA, under [Shan Lu](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) and [Sarah Fakhoury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sfakhoury/). In the summer of 2023, I participated in Carnegie Mellon University's [Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE)](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program under [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), researching [domain-specific program generation](assets/From_Prose_to_Programs_with_Penrose_REUSE_2023_Poster_Rijul_Jain.pdf) with large language models to democratize diagram authoring using [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/). As part of [previous research](assets/bitfridge-poster.pdf) with [Daniel Barowy](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~dbarowy/) at Williams, I've also implemented a programming language that describes and captures UNIX filesystem state, sidestepping problems with breaking system call API changes to safely express program semantics for OS platform- and version-agnostic execution.

Over the course of the 2024-25 academic year, I'm working on two honors theses, one in computer science and one in English. With Joshua Sunshine and [Bill Jannen](http://cs.williams.edu/~jannen/), I'm developing testing strategies and tools to better characterize errors in and improve the usability of visualization DSLs. With [Anita Sokolsky](https://english.williams.edu/profile/asokolsk/) and [Paresh Chandra](https://english.williams.edu/profile/pc16/), I'm refracting George Eliot's formal innovations through Theodor W. Adorno's aesthetic theory and Walter Benjamin's philosophy of history.
