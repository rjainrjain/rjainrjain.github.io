I’m an undergraduate at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and English. I’ll be a visiting student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year.

Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of **programming languages** and **human-computer interaction** at Carnegie Mellon University's [Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUSE)](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program under [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), researching domain-specific program generation with large language models to democratize diagram authoring using [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/). As part of previous research with [Daniel Barowy](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~dbarowy/) at Williams, I've also implemented a programming language that describes and captures UNIX filesystem state, safely expressing program semantics for OS platform/version-agnostic execution.

I'm also deeply invested in finding generative ways to reconcile the richness of the logics and interpretive modes of aesthetically daring [**literature**](https://www.ndbooks.com/book/the-rings-of-saturn/), [**literary theory**](https://thecharnelhouse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Fredric-Jameson-The-Antinomies-of-Realism-2015.pdf) and unconventional [**philosophy**](https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf)[(?)](https://seansturm.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/benjamin-theses-on-the-philosophy-of-history.pdf) with our various computational models of (and subsequent assumptions about) the world.
