I work on aesthetics and the philosophy of history in the nineteenth-century English novel and historiographically grounded computing serving the arts and humanities. 

I'm a PhD student in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [**University of Washington**](https://www.washington.edu/) advised by [Benjamin Charles Germain Lee](https://bcglee.github.io/) and [R. Benjamin Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/). In 2026-27, I'll take up an MPhil in English Studies at the [**University of Cambridge**](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), funded by a 2026 [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/). My doctoral research is supported by a 2025 [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org/).

I completed my BA in English and Computer Science, *summa cum laude*, with [Highest Honors](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12431114410002786) in English, at [**Williams College**](https://www.williams.edu/). I was a visiting student at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year on the [Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford](https://exeter.williams.edu/). 

I have designed and conducted [a study of expert users of proof-oriented languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02733) at [Microsoft Research], developed methods to [generate domain-specific programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3618305.3623612) with large language models to democratize diagram authoring at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/), and implemented a [programming language](assets/bitfridge-poster.pdf) to safely express program semantics for OS platform- and version-agnostic execution at Williams.

I'm a professionally trained stage actor and a classical pianist.
