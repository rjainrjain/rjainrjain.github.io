# Rijul Jain

I’m an undergraduate at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and English. I’ll be a visiting student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year.

I work at the intersection of *programming languages* and *human-computer interaction*—currently, I'm participating in Carnegie Mellon University's [Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUSE)](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program under [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), researching domain-specific program generation with large language models to democratize diagram authoring using [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/).
