Iâ€™m an undergraduate at [**Williams College**](https://www.williams.edu/) majoring in English and Computer Science. I was a visiting student at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year. Currently, I work on research at the intersection of **human-computer interaction**, **programming languages**, and **artificial intelligence**. I'm interested in computing education research as a space that can benefit from interactions with those three areas.

This summer, I designed and conducted a study of expert users of proof-oriented languages at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) in Redmond, WA, under [Shan Lu](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) and [Sarah Fakhoury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sfakhoury/). In the summer of 2023, I participated in Carnegie Mellon University's [Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE)](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program under [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [generating domain-specific programs](assets/From_Prose_to_Programs_with_Penrose_REUSE_2023_Poster_Rijul_Jain.pdf) with large language models to democratize diagram authoring with [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/). With [Daniel Barowy](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~dbarowy/) at Williams, I've implemented a [programming language](assets/bitfridge-poster.pdf) that describes and captures UNIX filesystem state, sidestepping problems with breaking system call API changes to safely express program semantics for OS platform- and version-agnostic execution.

I use he/they pronouns.
