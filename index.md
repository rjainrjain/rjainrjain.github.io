I am a first-year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student in the [Paul G. Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [**University of Washington**](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/) and [R. Benjamin Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/). I am a 2025 [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org/) recipient.

I completed my BA in English and Computer Science, summa cum laude, with [Highest Honors](https://librarysearch.williams.edu/discovery/delivery/01WIL_INST:01WIL_SPECIAL/12431114410002786) in English, at [**Williams College**](https://www.williams.edu/). I was a visiting student at the [**University of Oxford**](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/) for the 2023-24 academic year. 

In 2024, I designed and conducted a study of expert users of proof-oriented languages at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) in Redmond, WA, under [Shan Lu](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) and [Sarah Fakhoury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sfakhoury/). In the summer of 2023, I participated in Carnegie Mellon University's [Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE)](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program under [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [generating domain-specific programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3618305.3623612) with large language models to democratize diagram authoring with [Penrose](https://penrose.cs.cmu.edu/). With [Daniel Barowy](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~dbarowy/) at Williams, I've implemented a [programming language](assets/bitfridge-poster.pdf) that describes and captures UNIX filesystem state, sidestepping problems with breaking system call API changes to safely express program semantics for OS platform- and version-agnostic execution.
